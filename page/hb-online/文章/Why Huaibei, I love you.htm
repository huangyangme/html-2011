/* 弹性布局提示 
1. 由于弹性布局的总体大小取决于用户的默认字体大小，因此弹性布局更难预测。如果正确使用的话，弹性布局对于那些需要较大字体的用户更为方便，因为行的长度仍保持适当比例。
2. 此布局中 div 的大小取决于 body 元素中的 100% 字体大小。如果您通过对 body 元素或 #container 使用“font-size: 80%”来减小文本的总体大小，请记住整体布局将按比例缩小。您最好增加各个 div 的宽度以对此进行补偿。
3. 如果字体大小在每个 div 中按不同的量进行更改（例如，#sidebar1 上的字体大小为 70%，#mainContent 上的字体大小为 85%），而不是对总体设计进行更改，则将按比例更改每个 div 的总体大小。您最好根据最终的字体大小来进行调整。

    <blockquote>
      <p> When I first set off to the Middle Kingdom after years of curiosity I had no idea of where exactly I was going to arrive.</p>
      <p> Of course one can look at the pictures on the net but these never tell the whole story.</p>
      <p> Like any location on earth, it is always the way the people are in general that makes the place what it is.</p>
      <p> It was winter when I arrived in February 2009 it was misty and cold.</p>
      <p> Fine by me, I was brought up in misty and cold, years ago back in my native Yorkshire, a province in the north of England.</p>
      <p> Novelty is a great teacher, soon I was going regularly into the town to truly enjoy the vitality and to me the mystery of this very Chinese city.    </p>
      <p> I soon found the people were openly curious about this strange looking foreigner, and surprisingly honest and friendly. I found Friendship Street with its wonderful food stalls and began to enjoy a far greater variety of Chinese food than I had experienced before. It was fun to have owners of restaurants take pictures of me, they said, &quot;I was the first foreigner to eat in their place&quot;. Well my understanding of Chinese is non existent so I assume that is what they were saying.</p>
      <p> I had to learn to try to bargain with shopkeepers to purchase the warm clothing I needed to keep out the strange damp cold that Huaibei specializes in. I think they won. As they all usually do when I go shopping, I never was that great at bargaining. Not that, that bothers me, so long I was warm enough dressed the irreverence differences and curiosities to a new visitor could be enjoyed with great relish.</p>
      <p> Very soon after my arrival I had one very embarrassing moment getting on a very crowded bus, then falling over and pushing just about everyone standing on the bus over. There was a look of astonishment and amazement on faces of the other passengers, when they saw it was a very strange looking foreigner that had clumsily knocked them all over, talk about lose face. Unfortunately I have lost face a couple of other times, but that was the fault of a lack of experience with Baijiu (liquor) but I don&quot;t feel so alone about that in Huaibei.</p>
      <p> It did not take me long to adjust to this new type of life, living among a people I both admired and was curious about for many years although I have given up on the Baijiu.</p>
      <p> Ever since my boy hood I have been aware of the struggles of the Chinese people.</p>
      <p>Fortunately it is the tradition of my own culture in, Yorkshire, which is distinct from just being British, that we are not judgmental of others. Not only did my father tell me many times that we must like all people on earth, we are encouraged to be intellectually curious. I was very fortunate indeed to have the father and mother I had, who encouraged me to take constant interest in the developing aspects of the world we share.    </p>
      <p> It may even be of interest to Chinese who are both confused and curious about the west, that there are many differing cultures among the variety of people who are known as Westerners. There are a great variety of ways of thinking among westerners. From a religiously centric and relatively closed view to an open and scientifically minded one, with a good sense of humor. I belong to the latter.</p>
      <p> The particular one I was brought up in Yorkshire sees no separation between humans and we have no belief system that tells us this.</p>
      <p> So for this reason, it is quite easy to go to a distant land like China a different culture and gradually fit into the life here.</p>
      <p> Curiosity is my particular great driver. I am one of those very strange people always trying to see what is over the next hill or beyond the next bend in the winding path of life, so I began to walk further and further around Huaibei and its rather surprisingly, lovely and in may ways romantic country side.</p>
      <p> With the Xiangshan Park taking one onto the local mountain I soon realized this is a very wonderful place to live in. One has the mixture of the advantages of the city while within easy walking distance, or with very little cost one can get into the local countryside, visit the villages and observe the more traditional Chinese lifestyle.</p>
      <p> Through this I have gained great respect for the people who live in villages, I have begun to really appreciate the struggle of the Chinese people to pull by great individual and national effort them selves out of hardship and poverty.    </p>
      <p> It is also spiritually rewarding to come to Huaibei in the dead of winter, have the gods sprinkle it with snow, then see the whole of the four seasons give out the visual and natural beauty provided for by nature, Xiangshan Park and the mountain itself.</p>
      <p> I love the experience when on my walks of seeing an amazing amount of variety of flora and bird life. For some one who spent his boy hood and much of his youth exploring the wonderful nature of his home land I become habituated that way, discovering these new types of flora and some similar ones growing all over the mountain and through the countryside, it soon became a sort of little heaven.</p>
      <p> I truly congratulate the efforts of who ever it is that planted trees all over the little mountain of Huaibei, they deserve a medal for their amazing work. The people of Huaibei owe them a great thank you for what they have done.</p>
      <p> It is a shame though that people cannot teach their children not to drop litter around this wonderful place. I hope one day they get out of this habit it would truly make Huaibei and its park a really lovely piece of nature.</p>
      <p> Sure there are many splendid natural places all over the earth, China is surely blessed by its own geography, and natural history, but if one appreciates nature for what it simply provides, one does not have to go to the bother of traveling great distances to enjoy that which nature provides locally.</p>
      <p> I have become addicted to walking over the Xiangshan Mount and into the misty distance discovering the villages scattered around the base of the mountain.</p>
      <p> Because of the accessibility of the country side around the mountain, to me these are wonderful cultural experiences, as satisfying in many ways as going to many of the great tourist attractions.</p>
      <p> I am a practicing artist, the painterly aspects of the villages makes them richer in many ways than the cities, and people all too eagerly flock to. They provide some very interesting pictures to paint.</p>
      <p> I see great futures for village people as the economy of China grows and people gain wisdom as well as wealth, their ideal memory of their early years will grow and give impetus to the idea of retiring back in the village they grew up in. Taking some of their wealth and ideas with them building new modern and environmentally sophisticated homes, these new age villagers will be very much part of what continues China&quot;s economic development and gradually improves the life of all Chinese villagers and city folk alike.</p>
      <p> Because of the small distance between most of the villages and the Huaibei city centre commuting as many in other parts of China already do, from outer suburbia into the great metropolis built up in recent years through the endeavor of the Chinese people, it is not hard to envision just how wonderful Huaibei, and its surrounding satellite towns will become as another example of the success of China as Huaibei gradually evolves from a coal city and adapts to more modern ways.</p>
      <p> Many local people sort of apologize for Huaibei, saying it is a small city, it is not all shiny and splendid like the more wealthy cities of China, but there in lays its real charm.    </p>
      <p> In all of my life I have never lived among such honest people. Such honesty is true wealth. Wealth is after all a state of mind as much as an ability to shop, let us hope that regardless how Huaibei develops its people never lose their down to earth, charms.</p>
      <p> What really struck me is when I went back to Australia where I have lived for some years, then returned back to Huaibei after the summer holidays, how surprised I was when the train from Shanghai finally pulled into Huaibei station, how glad I was to return to this city. I felt like a local getting off that train. Pushing and shoving to get through the station gate and grab a taxi along with the rest of the returning passengers. Huaibei were I had only lived for some months felt more like home than Australia where I had spent many years ever did. I put it down to the people.</p>
      <p> What is remarkable is how similar Huaibei is to Sheffield, in its feel. Sheffield is a very a famous steel coal and industrial city in Yorkshire. Hardened steel for railways lines was invented there in the 1830s and altered the world for ever. Sheffield, is near to the small coal mining village of Maltby I was born and brought up, where my father worked as a coal miner, in some peculiar way I can&quot;t quite put down to anything else but the down to earth robust people who live in both places, as well as the similar Winter and Autumn climates, make it feel surprisingly normal to this foreigner.</p>
      <p> It will be a very difficult place to leave, I love it here. And by the way, one is only a foreigner until one gets drunk with others, they soon see you are just like them.</p>
      <p> Kind regards.</p>
